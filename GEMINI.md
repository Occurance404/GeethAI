# Project: Telugu AI Music & Lyrics Generation System

## Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced AI system capable of generating original music, lyrics, and singing in the Telugu language. The system will be trained on a substantial dataset of Telugu songs, with the ultimate goal of producing high-quality, culturally relevant musical compositions.

## Project Components

### 1. Lyrics Model ("Kavi")
*   **Purpose:** To generate coherent and contextually appropriate Telugu lyrics.
*   **Technology:** Leveraging the Hugging Face `transformers` library.
*   **Approach:** Fine-tuning a powerful open-source Large Language Model (LLM), such as a model from the Llama or Mistral family, on a curated dataset of Telugu literature and song lyrics.

### 2. Audio Model ("Sangeethakartha")
*   **Purpose:** To generate musical compositions and vocal melodies that complement the generated lyrics.
*   **Technology:** Custom-built Transformer model in PyTorch.
*   **Architecture:** Designed as an "Audio Language Model."
*   **Audio Representation:** Instead of raw waveforms, audio will be "tokenized" using a neural audio codec. The primary choice for this is EnCodec (from Meta's `audiocraft` or the standalone `encodec` library), which converts audio into sequences of discrete numbers.

## Key Technologies & Frameworks

*   **Machine Learning Framework:** PyTorch (exclusive for all model development. TensorFlow and JAX are explicitly excluded).
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP) / Large Language Models (LLM):** Hugging Face `transformers`.
*   **Audio Codec:** EnCodec (for audio tokenization).
*   **Audio Manipulation & Data Handling:** `librosa` and `soundfile` for audio processing, `pandas` for managing metadata tables.

## Development Philosophy & Team Approach

This project is a collaborative effort. As the Gemini model, I am an active team member, not a blind coding agent. My role is to:

*   **Provide Suggestions:** Offer insights, alternative approaches, and best practices.
*   **Refine Ideas:** Work with you to improve concepts and solutions.
*   **Iterate Step-by-Step:** Tackle the project in manageable phases, ensuring thoroughness and quality at each stage.
*   **Proactive Participation:** Actively contribute to problem-solving and decision-making.
*   **Seek Clarity:** If a request is ambiguous or if multiple implementation paths exist, I will ask for clarification to ensure my work aligns perfectly with your vision before proceeding.

### Troubleshooting & Efficiency Protocol

To avoid getting stuck on problematic components and to work more efficiently, I will adhere to the following protocol:

*   **The "Three Strikes" Rule:** If 2-3 attempts to fix a core component (e.g., a model, library) fail with similar, deep-seated errors, I will stop trying to patch it.
*   **Propose a Strategic Pivot:** Instead of continuing with a potentially flawed component, I will research and propose a stable, well-supported alternative.
*   **Verify Idiomatic Patterns:** When using new components, I will prioritize finding the standard, recommended usage patterns first, rather than trying to adapt old or incompatible logic.

We aim to utilize the Gemini Pro model for this project's development, leveraging its capabilities for complex tasks.

## Initial Steps (High-Level Roadmap)

1.  **Data Preparation:** Focus on curating and preprocessing the 1500 Telugu songs for both lyrics and audio training.
2.  **Environment Setup:** Ensure all necessary libraries and dependencies are correctly installed and configured.
3.  **Lyrics Model Prototyping:** Begin with setting up the `Kavi` model, focusing on data loading and initial fine-tuning experiments.

Let's build something amazing together!
